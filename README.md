# 8-queens using Genetic Algorithms

Solves for the 8-queens problem using genetic algorithms.

# Running the Program

To run the program run the following command.

`python3 main.py`

Note: No arguments defaults to a population size of 100 and a mutation chance of %10

To run the program with arguments run the following command.

`python3 main.py populationSize mutationChance`

_populationSize_ is of type _int_

_mutationChance_ is of type _float_


### Examples

`python3 main.py 200 0.25`

`python3 main.py 333 0.33`
